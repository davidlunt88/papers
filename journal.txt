Title:
Model-Measurement intercomparison of biogenic SOA in west Africa

Introduction:

In this paper we present measurements of aersol particles made over forests in West Africa.
Chemical compositions anmd mass concentrations were measured using and AMS
(Allen et al 2004).
Smith et al 2007 made measurtements in this region, anmd while they were great, we mneed more in order to answer questions theyu were unable to address.

Simulations:
We present here simulations of aerosol partical formation, using a chamber model.

Methodology:
We used various particle counters to measure the size distributions. The instruments were described in Green et al 2010.
